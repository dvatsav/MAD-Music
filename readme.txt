*** This program uses shell script, bash. Certain repositories must be downloaded before using this code. The required repositories are present in the folder installation.sh that may be run from the terminal. The installations require root access at times, so the user is requested to read the installation file before installing in case the files are changed during redistribution ***

Place mad.sh in whichever folder you wish to use for your music and run the script from there.

Enjoy :)
